# GUI

In java we can use tools like AWT, SWING, etc to create GUI. AWT and SWING are the most popular tools to create GUI in java.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)

AWT contains large numbers of classes and methods that allows you to create and manage graphical user interface(GUI) such as windows, buttons, scrollbars,textblocks ,etc.

The awt was designed to provide a common set of tools for GUI design that could work on a variety of platforms.

The tools provided by the awt are implemented using each platforms native GUI toolkit, hence preserving the look and feel of each platform. It is an advantage of awt.

But the disadvantage of such an approach is that GUI designed on one platform may look different when displayed on another platform.

Awt is the foundation upon which swing is made.

SWING / JFC (Java Foundation Class)

SWING is a extended version of AWT. It contains all tge classes and methods as in AWT with additional classes and methods of its own.

The declaration of the components are same as in AWT with a J infront of every classes.

It needs JavaX.swing; package to run.

Layout used

Grid Layout

It is used to arrange the components in rectangular grid.

GridLayout class is used to achieve the grid layout

GridLayout() takes four parameters , i.e Rows and Columns/ Hspace and Vspace

Example :- GridLayout(2,2,20,30); = 2 rows,2 columns,20 hspace,30 vspace

Components

The component is an abstract class that encapsulates all the attributes of a visual Components.

Except for menus, all user interface elements that are displayed on the screen and that interact with the user of subclasses of 
Component.

A Component object is responsible for remembering the current foreground and background colors and the currently selected text font.

Labels

Labels are passive controls that do not support any interaction with the user i.e. no event handling.

A label is an object of type Label and it contains a String, which it displays.

Label defines the following constructors:

i. Label() throws HeadLessException

ii. Label(String str) throws HeadLessException // The string is left justified.

iii. Label(String str, int how) throws HeadLessException // label.LEFT, label.RIGHT
Button

The most widely used control is the push button. A push button is a Component that contains a label and that generates an event when it is pressed. Push buttons are objects of type button. Button defines these two constructors:

Constructors

public Button()

public Button(String buttonLabel) throws headless Exception;

TextField

The TextField class implements a single line text entry area ususally called an edit control.

TextField allow the user to enter strings and to edit the text using the arrow keys, cut and paste keys and mouse selection.

Constructors

public TextField(String initialText, int columns)

Construct a TextField instance with the given initial text string with the number of column

public TextField(String strText);

Set the text display text on this TextField instance

public TextField(int columns);

Construct s TextField instance with number of columns

TextArea

Sub class of TextComponent

Sometimes a single line of text input is not enough for a given task. To handle this situation, the awt includes a simple multiline editor called TextArea.
Constructors

TextArea() throws 

TextArea(int numLines, int numChars) throws HeadlessException

TextArea(String str) throws HeadlessException

TextArea(Stirng str, int numLines, numChars) throws HeadlessException

TextArea(String str, int numLines,int numChars, int sBars) throws HeadlessException

Here, numLines represents rows and numChars represents number of columns. sBars is Scroll Bar to use scrollbar in the TextArea.

Checkbox
A Checkbox is a control that is used to turn an option on or off.

It consists of a small box tha can either contain a checkmark or not.

There is a Label associated with each check box that describes what option the box represents.

Can change the state of a Checkbox by clicking on it.

Constructors:

Checkbox() throws HeadlessException

Checkbox(String str) throws HeadlessException

Checkbox(String str, boolean on) throws HeadlessException

Checkbox(String str, boolean on, CheckboxGroup cbGroup) throws HeadlessException

Checkbox(String str, CheckboxGroup cbGroup, boolean on) throws HeadlessException

CheckboxGroup
It is possible to create a set if mutually exclusive check boxes in which one and only one checkbox in the group can be checked at any one time.

Also known as radio button.

Constructors CheckboxGroup();

Choice

Same as Select in HTML

The Choice class is used to create a pop-up list of items from which user may choose.

Only one item can be chosen.

Constructors: Choice();

List

The List class provides a compact, multiple-choice scrolling selection list.

Constructors

List() throws HeadlessException

List(int numRows) throws HeadlessException

List( int numRows, boolean multipleSelect) throws HeadlessException

numRows number of rows will be visible, if false, then only one item may be selected.
